# odin-recipes

This project created with the help of The Odin Project details some of my favorite recipes from the food magazine Bon Appétit. The recipes are sourced directly from the Bon Appétit website, so special thanks to the folks at BA for providing the world with some tasty food.

The project aims to help me exercise some of the basic HTML skills I've reviewed on The Odin Project thus far. Though I am not completely new to the world of HTML & CSS (having taken a class on website-building and some introductory CS courses), it feels good to polish my HTML abilities after such a long time spent away from coding.
