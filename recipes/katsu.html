        <img src="../img/katsu.jpg" alt="Spicy chicken katsu sandwiches">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These sandwiches combine the shattering panko crispiness of katsu-style cutlets and the fiery heat found in Nashville-style hot chicken with some cooling shredded lettuce to put out the fire.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped bread-and-butter pickles</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. plus ¼ cup hot sauce, such as Crystal</li>
            <li>1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, lightly pounded to ½" thick</li>
            <li>¼ cup (or more) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>8 slices milk bread</li>
            <li>Shredded iceberg lettuce (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine mayonnaise, pickles, and 2 Tbsp. hot sauce in a small bowl. Season with salt; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, cayenne, garlic powder, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Whisk egg and remaining ¼ cup hot sauce in another medium bowl. Place panko on a large plate. Working one at a time, dip chicken into flour dredge, turning to coat. Shake off any excess. Dip into egg mixture until coated, shaking off excess. Dredge in panko, turning to coat. Transfer to a large plate or a small rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, reducing heat to medium if it's browning too quickly, until golden and very crisp on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Spread reserved spicy mayo on one side of each slice of bread. Top with chicken and shredded lettuce, then close up sandwiches.</li>
        </ol>
