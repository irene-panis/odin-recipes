        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Humble ingredients-- eggs, noodles, cheese, and pork-- combine to create glossy, glorious pasta carbonara. It's the no-food-in-the-house dinner of our dreams.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
            <li>4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
            <li>2 oz. Parmesan</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat <strong>6 qt. water</strong> in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add <strong>3 Tbsp. salt</strong> and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
            <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove <strong>4 oz. guanciale</strong> from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate <strong>2 oz. cheese</strong> and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
            <li>Whisk <strong>4 egg yolks</strong> and <strong>2 whole eggs</strong> in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of <strong>pepper</strong> and set aside.</li>
            <li>Working next to pot, heat <strong>2 Tbsp. oil</strong> in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
            <li>Cook <strong>1 lb. pasta</strong> in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid into reserved egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won't use all of it).</li>
            <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
        </ol>
